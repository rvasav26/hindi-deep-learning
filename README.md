# Hindi Deep Learning
Used dataset of 9,000+ handwritten Devanagari characters to develop and train a TensorFlow convolutional neural network (CNN). 
Using OpenCV and NumPy, I developed a program to enable users to write characters on an online scratchpad. The CNN recieves the image of the handrwitten text in the form of a NumPy array and, after performing matrix transformations, makes a prediction of the character. This process is entirely in real-time, and the user receives feedback from the model with a latency under 100 milliseconds.
Maximum accuracy achieved was 93% (correct predictions of characters/total predictions)
