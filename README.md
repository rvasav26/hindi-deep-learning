# Hindi Optical Character Recognition
Used dataset of handwritten Devanagari characters from Kaggle Dataset to develop and train Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. 
Used TensorFlow to develop model, and exported it to PyCharm project. From there, using OpenCV and NumPy, I developed a program to enable users to write characters on an online scratchpad. The CNN model would recieve the image of the text in the form of a NumPy array and, after performing matrix transformations, feed the array into the CNN model and the user would receive the detection of the characters written in real-time.
Maximum accuracy achieved was 97% (correct predictions of characters/total predictions)
